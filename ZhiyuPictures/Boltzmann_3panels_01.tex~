\caption{the energy distribution measured in $\sim 10000$ time units, as will be verified later, Green curves corresponds to Boltzmann distribution; Red curves are obviously non-Boltzmann, while the yellow ones are intermediate case, represent ``thermalization threshold". In three figures for different N, we choose E/N identical (=1000), and thermalization is reached at $F_0=500\sim1000$, which is consistent with our prediction in Eq.\ref{eq:thermalizatiton condition}}
