  abstract = {Numerical evidence is presented that the canonical distribution for a subsystem of a closed classical system of a ring of coupled harmonic oscillators (integrable system) or magnetic moments (nonintegrable system) follows directly from the solution of the time-reversible Newtonian equation of motion in which the total energy is strictly conserved. Without performing ensemble averaging or introducing fictitious thermostats, it is shown that this observation holds even though the whole system may contain as little as a few thousand particles. In other words, we demonstrate that the canonical distribution holds for subsystems of experimentally relevant sizes and observation times.},

  abstract      = {Ultracold atomic physics offers myriad possibilities to study strongly correlated many-body systems in lower dimensions. Typically, only ground-state phases are accessible. Using a tunable quantum gas of bosonic cesium atoms, we realized and controlled in one-dimensional geometry a highly excited quantum phase that is stabilized in the presence of attractive interactions by maintaining and strengthening quantum correlations across a confinement-induced resonance. We diagnosed the crossover from repulsive to attractive interactions in terms of the stiffness and energy of the system. Our results open up the experimental study of metastable, excited, many-body phases with strong correlations and their dynamical properties.},
